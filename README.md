SeaTop is a suite of applications designed to be used while on the water for pleasure, designed with the sailing keelboat racer in mind. Tested by the crew of Illyra, J120, in Charleston, SC during Charleston Ocean Racing Association (CORA) inshore and offshore events. Developed by ntbrock while on a container ship adventure from the Panama Canal to Philadelphia aboard the MV Spirit of Singapore. Days at sea with no internet / reticulum connection can grant new insight.

SeaTop is inspired by the unix top command, designed to take complex data and provide simple moving averages for the operator to quickly vsualize trends and outliers to help make better tactical decisions.

This application is built for the original Pebble Watch, aplite, which is waterproof and connected via a cheap Android device that is powered below decks. Data is acquired from any NMEA 0183 or NEMA 2000 / SeatalkNG network, typically aggregated via Raspberry Pi, Nexus NX2 Server or kplex open source software.
